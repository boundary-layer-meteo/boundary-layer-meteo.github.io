# The stable boundary layer (ii)

```{admonition} Questions to be answered in this chapter
1. Which three states of the stable boundary layer exist?
1. What is the driving mechanism behind intermittency?
```

This lecture introduced no new mathematics, but explained how the interplay of shear enhancing low level jets and stability increasing long wave cooling are competing and alternate the state of the stable boundary layer between stable and unstable. Please study the slides and the flow chart there and your lecture notes.
