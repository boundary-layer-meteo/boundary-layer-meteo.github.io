# Turbulent fluxes and the atmospheric surface layer

```{admonition} Questions to be answered
1. How do we compute the vertical turbulent flux from time or space series of $u$ and $w$?
```

This lecture did not introduce new concepts, but explained the concept of turbulent fluxes from animations and data (so study the slides carefully!).

In short, we have shown that a time- or spatial series of $u$ and $w$ allows for the computation of the turbulent flux $\overline{u^\prime w^\prime}$ in the following steps

1. Compute the means $\overline{u}$ and $\overline{w}$.
1. Subtract the means from the series to obtain $u^\prime$ and $w^\prime$.
1. Multiply the perturbations to obtain a series $u^\prime w^\prime$.
1. Take the mean the series $u^\prime w^\prime$ and obtain the flux $\overline{u^\prime w^\prime}$.
