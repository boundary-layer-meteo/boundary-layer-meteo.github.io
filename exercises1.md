# Exercises week 1

## 
Calculate the Reynolds number of the following flows $(\nu_{air}=1.5~10^{-5} m^2/s,
\nu_{water}=1.~10^{-6} m^2/s, \nu_{blood}=3.8~10^{-6} m^2/s)$. Classify if these flows are laminar or turbulent.

a) Atmospheric convective boundary layer (W=1 m/s, L=1000 m)

b) Oceanic internal waves (U = 5 cm/s, L= 10 km)

c) Blood circulation ( U = 30 cm/s, L=1 cm)

## 
The velocity and the temperature fields of a flow are given by:

$$
\vec U=(2x^2, xy, lnx+zy)~(m/s) ~~~~~~ T = 4x + zy ~(C)
$$

a) Calculate the temperature gradient at the point (0, 1, 1).

b) Calculate the velocity divergence at the point (-2, 4, 0). Is
it a incompressible or compressible flow at this point?

c) Calculate the velocity curl at (1, 1, 1).

d) Given the surface mixing ratio of 15 g/kg at the surface pressure of 1003 mb, calculate
the potential temperature and the virtual potential temperature at the point
(5, 1, 2) and at the pressure 850 mb ($R_d=287~J/KgK, c_p=1004~J/KgK$).

## 
Let $c$ be a constant, $t$ a function of time and $A$ and $B$ turbulent
variables. Expand the following terms into a mean and turbulent parts and apply
Reynolds rules to simplify the expressions as much as possible.

a) $\overline{cAB}$

b) $\overline{A\pafg{B}{t}}$

c) $\overline{\pafg{A}{t}\pafg{B}{t}}$

d) $\overline{c \nabla^2 A}$


## 
The following terms are given in summation notation. Expand them (that is, write
out each term of the indicated sums).

a) $ \pafg{\overline{u_i'u_j'}}{x_j} $

b) $ u_i'\pafg{\theta'}{x_i}    $

c) $ \overline{U_j} \pafg{\overline{u_i'u_k'}}{x_j} $

d) $ \overline{u_i'u_j'} \pafg{\overline{U_k}}{x_j}  $

e) $ \delta_{i3}g $

f) $ \pafg{\tau_{mn}}{x_n} $


## 
With a frequency of 1 Hz and during 8 seconds we have measured the following values of the
vertical velocity and specific humidity

\[
w~(m/s)~~~0~~-2~~-1~~1~~-2~~2~~1~~1
\]

\[
q~(g/kg)~~8~~~9~~~9~~6~~10~~3~~5~~6
\]

a) Calculate the time average of $w$ and $q$

b) Calculate the moisture flux. What is the direction of the flux?

c) Calculate the vertical velocity and specific humidity variances

## 
We have measured in a meteorological mast the following values
for the wind: U(2 m)= 2.8 m/s and U(20 m) = 5.75 m/s.

a) Calculating using linear interpolation the value of the
wind at 9 m.

b) If the wind velocity gradient reads:

$$
\pafg{U}{z}=\frac{u_*}{\kappa~z}.
$$

Assuming the following values for the friction velocity (=0.5 m/s),
the roughness length (=20 cm) and the Von Karman constant (=0.4),
calculate the wind speed at 9 m.

c) Estimate the error associated to the calculation of the wind speed using
the finite difference method.

## 
During a measurement campaign the following vertical profile
of potential temperature was measured at 14 UTC (see figure 1.1).

a) Identify and name each of the layers indicated in the figures
with the letters A, B, C and D and describe the main
characteristics of the behavior of the potential temperature.

b) Find the vertical gradient of temperature

$$\pafg{\theta}{z}\sim\frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta z}$$

for each of the layers above mentioned.

c) Discuss the conditions of the atmospheric stability for each
layer (refer to your answer to point b)
